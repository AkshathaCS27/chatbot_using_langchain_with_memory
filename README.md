# Conversational Chatbot with Memory
This project demonstrates a conversational chatbot built using LangChain. The chatbot leverages memory to maintain the context of conversations, providing coherent, personalized, and dynamic interactions. Powered by OpenAI's GPT models, this chatbot is ideal for applications requiring intelligent and context-aware communication.

Features
Context-Aware Conversations:
Retains memory of the dialogue to offer consistent and relevant responses.

Customizable Personality:
Fine-tune the chatbot's tone, style, and behavior using a prompt template.

Scalable and Modular:
Easily extend functionality by integrating APIs, advanced memory types, or custom tools.

Powered by GPT Models:
Utilizes state-of-the-art language models for intelligent and human-like interactions.

How It Works
Prompt Template:
A pre-defined template structures the chatbotâ€™s responses based on user input and conversation history.

Memory Integration:
ConversationBufferMemory stores the dialogue, enabling seamless context tracking across sessions.

LangChain Integration:
LangChain's ConversationChain orchestrates the memory, prompt, and language model for a robust conversational pipeline.

Dynamic Response Generation:
OpenAI GPT models process inputs and generate context-aware replies.
